Introduction
This project simulates RF signal propagation from access points in an outdoor environment with obstacles (occlusions) and visualizes the signal strength across a 2D grid. It is designed to be fast and efficient, suitable for research and development in indoor/outdoor positioning systems.

Features
Simulates RF signal propagation using a simplified path loss model.
Accounts for signal attenuation due to obstacles.
Visualizes signal strength on a grid using color gradients.
Easily customizable grid size, access point placement, and obstacle configuration.
Written in C++ for performance.
Prerequisites
Operating System: macOS (instructions are for macOS, but the code is cross-platform).
Compiler: g++ or clang++ with C++11 support.
Package Manager: Homebrew (for installing dependencies).
SFML Library: Simple and Fast Multimedia Library for the visualizer.
Xcode Command Line Tools: Provides necessary compilers and tools.
Installation
1. Install Xcode Command Line Tools
Open Terminal and run:

bash
Copy code
xcode-select --install
2. Install Homebrew
If you don't have Homebrew installed:

bash
Copy code
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
3. Install SFML
Use Homebrew to install SFML:

bash
Copy code
brew install sfml
4. Install pkg-config
bash
Copy code
brew install pkg-config
Usage
1. Clone the Repository
After pushing your project to GitHub (instructions below), you can clone it:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
2. Compile the RF Simulator
bash
Copy code
g++ -std=c++11 rf_simulator.cpp -o rf_simulator
3. Run the RF Simulator
bash
Copy code
./rf_simulator
This will generate a signal_strength.txt file containing the simulation data.

4. Compile the Visualizer
bash
Copy code
g++ -std=c++11 rf_visualizer.cpp -o rf_visualizer $(pkg-config --cflags --libs sfml-all)
5. Run the Visualizer
bash
Copy code
./rf_visualizer
A window titled "RF Signal Strength Visualizer" will open, displaying the signal strength grid.

Project Structure
rf_simulator.cpp: The main simulation code.
rf_visualizer.cpp: The visualization code using SFML.
signal_strength.txt: Generated by the simulator; used by the visualizer.
README.md: Documentation and instructions.
Customization
Modifying the Simulator
Grid Size: Change GRID_WIDTH and GRID_HEIGHT in rf_simulator.cpp.
Access Points: Modify calls to env.addAccessPoint(x, y, TX_POWER); with desired coordinates.
Obstacles: Adjust the loops adding obstacles in main() to change their placement and size.
Simulation Parameters: Tweak TX_POWER, PATH_LOSS_EXPONENT, and OBSTACLE_ATTENUATION constants.
Modifying the Visualizer
Cell Size: Change CELL_SIZE in rf_visualizer.cpp to adjust the visual representation size.
Color Mapping: Adjust the getColorFromSignal() function to change how signal strengths map to colors.
