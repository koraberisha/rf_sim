# RF Signal Propagation Simulator

## Introduction

This project simulates RF signal propagation from access points in an outdoor environment with obstacles (occlusions) and visualizes the signal strength across a 2D grid. It is designed to be fast and efficient, suitable for research and development in indoor/outdoor positioning systems.

## Features

- Simulates RF signal propagation using a simplified path loss model
- Accounts for signal attenuation due to obstacles
- Visualizes signal strength on a grid using color gradients
- Easily customizable grid size, access point placement, and obstacle configuration
- Written in C++ for performance

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: macOS (instructions are for macOS, but the code is cross-platform)
- **Compiler**: `g++` or `clang++` with C++11 support
- **Package Manager**: Homebrew (for installing dependencies)
- **SFML Library**: Simple and Fast Multimedia Library for the visualizer
- **Xcode Command Line Tools**: Provides necessary compilers and tools

## Installation

1. Install Xcode Command Line Tools:
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

2. Install Homebrew (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

3. Install SFML:
   ```bash
   brew install sfml
   ```

4. Install pkg-config:
   ```bash
   brew install pkg-config
   ```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/koraberisha/rf_sim.git
   cd rf_sim
   ```

2. Compile the RF Simulator:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++11 rf_simulator.cpp -o rf_simulator
   ```

3. Run the RF Simulator:
   ```bash
   ./rf_simulator
   ```
   This will generate a `signal_strength.txt` file containing the simulation data.

4. Compile the Visualizer:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++11 rf_visualizer.cpp -o rf_visualizer $(pkg-config --cflags --libs sfml-all)
   ```

5. Run the Visualizer:
   ```bash
   ./rf_visualizer
   ```
   A window titled "RF Signal Strength Visualizer" will open, displaying the signal strength grid.

## Project Structure

- `rf_simulator.cpp`: The main simulation code
- `rf_visualizer.cpp`: The visualization code using SFML
- `signal_strength.txt`: Generated by the simulator; used by the visualizer
- `README.md`: This documentation file

## Customization

### Modifying the Simulator

- **Grid Size**: Change `GRID_WIDTH` and `GRID_HEIGHT` in `rf_simulator.cpp`
- **Access Points**: Modify calls to `env.addAccessPoint(x, y, TX_POWER);` with desired coordinates
- **Obstacles**: Adjust the loops adding obstacles in `main()` to change their placement and size
- **Simulation Parameters**: Tweak `TX_POWER`, `PATH_LOSS_EXPONENT`, and `OBSTACLE_ATTENUATION` constants

### Modifying the Visualizer

- **Cell Size**: Change `CELL_SIZE` in `rf_visualizer.cpp` to adjust the visual representation size
- **Color Mapping**: Adjust the `getColorFromSignal()` function to change how signal strengths map to colors
